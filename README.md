# Sea Ice Age Computation

This repository contains code for computing the age of sea ice using satellite data and numerical algorithms. The project is designed to process input datasets, apply age-tracking logic, and output maps or statistics of sea ice age.

## Features

- Ingests satellite-derived sea ice concentration and motion data
- Advects triangular mesh for reducing diffusion
- Outputs age maps in standard formats (e.g., NetCDF, GeoTIFF)
- Modular and extensible codebase

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sea_ice_age.git
cd sea_ice_age
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Create directories that contain OSISAF sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea ice drift (SID)

Run the notebooks in the following order:

01preprocess_sid.ipynb - collocation of SID and SIC products, reprojection on EASE2 grid

02move_mesh.ipynb - advect triangular mesh using SID

03interpolate_sic.ipynb - interpolate SIC onto advected mesh elements

04find_autumn_minima.ipynb - find MYI concentration for 15 September each year

05propagate_myi.ipynb - propage MYI concentration using the advected mesh

06compute_age.ipynb - use the propageted MYI concentration from different start years to compute ice age fractions

07uncert_ice_drift.ipynb - compute uncertainty of sea ice drift

08uncert_ice_conc.ipynb - compute uncertainty of sea ice concentration

09uncert_combined.ipynb - compute combained sea ice drift and concentration uncertaimty

10uncert_total.ipynb - compute total uncertainty

11grid_age.ipynb - interpolate the age fractions from the advected triangular mesh onto grid

12netcdf_age.ipynb - create netCDFs

Directories `iabp_validation` and `figures` contain notebooks for the ESSD manuscript.
